AN5270 is the key here, with all the hci/aci functions!


APP_BLE_Init()
 # init_gap_gatt()
 # SVCCTL_INIT() --> SVCCTL_Svc_init()
 ## DIS_Init()
      initialized the DIS_Context to 0.  (this is placed in ram explicitly?! (is BLE_DRIVER_CONTEXT just null though? I think I remmeber that from earlier reading (yes, ST says gone https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000pQuUm/stm32wb-placeinsection)
      aci_gatt_add_service....
      aci_gatt_add_char() for each variable, which provides a char handle back into the context.
 ## HRS_Init()
      registers a service handler.
      aci_gatt_add_service
      aci_gatt_add_char() for each variable 
      if OTA: aci_gatt_add_char() for that one too 
 ## Kustom_init()
      blah....
   
Later....

 ## DISAPP_Init()
     DIS_Data_t setup.  just a holder to pass into the dis_updatechar, pretty useless.
     DIS_UpdateChar() for each of them, one by one...
         which is aci_gatt_update_char_value
     ... That's it, there doesn't seem to be much reason to split this into two pieces?    
           
 ## HRSAPP_Init()
